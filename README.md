Every company needs some bonding and team building even [Forbes says so](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianscudamore/2016/03/09/why-team-building-is-the-most-important-investment-youll-make/). 

A nice bit of escapism for a team is pretending to be somewhere else and attempted to work together to beat the common challenge, to support this, the Lasers and Feelings RPG helper was intended as a quick-and-easy way of beginning a team journey into Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPG).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
